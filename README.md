# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

Tutorial Link: https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/road-to-web3/weekly-learning-challenges/2.-how-to-build-buy-me-a-coffee-defi-dapp#deploy-your-buymeacoffe.sol-smart-contract-to-the-ethereum-goerli-testnet-using-alchemy-and-metamask

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
